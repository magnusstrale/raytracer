# The Ray Tracer in Rust

This repo contains the code that I've written by following the Ray Tracer Challenge book. It is
intended for my personal development, but if someone finds it useful - please let me know.

Running the code will produce a number of .png-files from the various stages of the book. Some
files will take time to produce since they are rendered in higher resolution. I e don't
assume that the program hangs when you start it and nothing happens. Hang on for a minute
and everything will be fine.

## How to run the code

- Download the code
- run 'cargo test raytracer' to run the tests
- run 'cargo run raytracer' to get some sample files

## What is the three_spheres_acne.png file?

This is a sample file that was produced when some of the finer points in ray tracing showed up - 
the concept of 'self shadowing'. I decided to keep it around and since the code no longer can 
produce a file like that it ended up in the repo.
